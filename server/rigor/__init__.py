# Expression handling is recursive: the parser walks a parenthesised group or a
# right-hand operand with a Python call per nesting level, and the AST helpers
# (`walk`, `format_node`, the SMT translation) recurse over the tree.  CPython's
# default limit of 1000 therefore caps a plain polynomial at roughly 300 terms
# and a nested expression at roughly 100 levels, which is well below what a
# legitimate call can contain; a 3,000-term expansion was rejected outright with
# a bare RecursionError.  Pure-Python frames in 3.11+ live on the heap rather
# than the C stack, so a higher limit costs memory, not stability: with 20,000
# the parser handles a 6,000-term sum and 1,000 levels of nesting, and anything
# larger still fails cleanly (the server turns RecursionError into an actionable
# message rather than a traceback).  Interactive callers may override this by
# setting a higher limit before importing the toolkit.
